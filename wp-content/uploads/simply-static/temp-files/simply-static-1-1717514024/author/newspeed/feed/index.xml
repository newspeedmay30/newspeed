<p>While these all mean different things, they essentially do the same thing: <strong>define an element’s dimensions in CSS</strong>. We need units in CSS because they determine how to size elements on a page, whether it’s the <code>height</code> of a box, the <code>width</code> of an image, the <code>font-size</code> of a heading, the <code>margin</code> between two elements, how long an animation runs, etc. Without them, the browser would have no way of knowing how to apply numbers to an element.</p>
<p>So, what the heck <em>is</em> <code>px</code>? What’s up with this thing called <code>rem</code>? How are these different than other length units? <strong>The unit defines what type of number we’re dealing with, and each one does something different, giving us lots of ways to size things in CSS.</strong></p>

<p>You may think a number is just a number, and you’re not wrong. Numbers are numbers! But we can distinguish between a few different <em>types</em> of numbers, which is helpful context for discussing the different types of units we attach them to since “number” can mean, well, a <em>number</em> of different things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integers</strong> (literally a unit-less number, e.g. <code>3</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Numbers</strong> (same as an integer, only measured in decimals, e.g. <code>3.2</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Dimensions</strong> (either a number or integer with a unit, e.g. <code>3.2rem</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Ratios</strong> (the quotient between two divided numbers, e.g. <code>3/2</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Percentages</strong> (e.g. <code>3%</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Got that? They’re all numbers but with nuances that make them ever-so-slightly different. </p>
<p>From here, we can think of numbers in CSS as falling into two specific types of <em>units</em>: <strong>absolute</strong> and <strong>relative</strong>. Let’s start things off our deep dive on CSS length units by breaking those down.</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="absolute-units"><a href="#aa-absolute-units" aria-hidden="true" class="aal_anchor" id="aa-absolute-units"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="aal_svg" height="16" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"/></svg></a>Absolute units</h3>
<p>An <strong>absolute unit</strong> is like Bill Murray in the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Groundhog Day</em></a>: it’s always the same. In other words, whatever the number is, that’s exactly how it computes in the browser regardless of how other elements are sized.</p>
<p>The most common absolute value you’ll see is the <strong>pixel</strong> value. It’s sort of hard to define, but a pixel is the <em>smallest</em> building block of a graphical display, like a computer screen. And it’s based on the resolution of the screen. So, if you’re on a super high-resolution screen, a pixel will be smaller than it would be on a low-resolution screen, as the resolution can pack more pixels into a smaller amount of space for higher clarity. But look at the example below. All of the boxes are sized with pixels, so you can get a sense of how large <code>50px</code> is compared to <code>250px</code>.</p>
<p><iframe id="cp_embed_GREQQMX" src="https://codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/GREQQMX?height=650&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=GREQQMX&amp;default-tab=css,result" height="650" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allowpaymentrequest="" name="CodePen Embed GREQQMX" title="CodePen Embed GREQQMX" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></p>
<p>Absolute values are nice in that they are predictable. That could, however, change in some situations, particularly when it comes to <em>zooming</em>. If, say, a user zooms into a page using browser settings, then anything defined with an absolute value is going to increase its absolute size accordingly. So, if the <code>font-size</code> of a paragraph is set to <code>20px</code>, the paragraph is going to be larger as the user zooms closer into the page. And because zooming is often used to make content more readable, using absolute values that retain their sizing could be a good approach for making pages more accessible by allowing users to zoom things up to a spot that more comfortable to read.</p>
<p>But then again, see Josh Collinsworth’s click-baity, but fantastic, post titled <a href="https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/never-use-px-for-font-size" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Why you should never use <code>px</code> to set <code>font-size</code> in CSS”</a> for an exhaustive explanation of how pixels behave when used to set the <code>font-size</code> of an element. It’s a great read to better understand the behavior and limitations of pixel units.</p>
<p>And, hey: pixels are only one of many types of absolute lengths that are available in CSS. In fact, we can group them by the types of things they measure:</p>
<details>
<summary>
          Length units      </summary>
<p><strong>Length units</strong> are a little funny because they can technically be either an absolute unit <em>or</em> a relative unit. But we’re discussing them in absolute terms at the moment and will revisit them when we get further along to relative length units.</p>
<p>A length is essentially a dimension, which is any integer proceeded by a unit, according to the list of types of numbers we looked at earlier. And when we talk about <em>dimensions</em>, we’re really talking about the <em>physical size</em> of an element.</p>

<p>You won’t see <strong>frequency units</strong> used very often and for good reason: <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_frequency" rel="noopener" target="_blank">they’re not supported by any browser</a> at the time of this writing. But they’re <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#frequency" rel="noopener" target="_blank">specced to change sound frequency</a>, such as a sound’s pitch. The best I can make of it as it currently stands is that frequencies can be used to manipulate an audio file with a higher or lower pitch measured in hertz and kilohertz.</p>

<p>If you’re wondering what constitutes a “low” pitch from a “high” one, the spec explains it like this:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>[W]hen representing sound pitches, 200Hz (or 200hz) is a bass sound, and 6kHz (or 6khz) is a treble sound.</p>

<summary>
          Resolution units      </summary>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> is how many little dots are packed into a screen — such as the screen you’re looking at right now — where more dots per inch of space improves the clarity and quality of the display. The fewer dots there are, the more pixelated and blurry the display.</p>
<p>Why would you need something like this? Well, it’s great for targeting styles to specific screens that support certain resolutions in a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media query</a>.</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">img {
  max-width: 500px;
}

/* Double the resolution and above */
@media (min-resolution &gt;= 2dppx) {
  img {
    max-width: 100%;
  }
}</code></pre>

</figure>
<p>Interestingly, the specification makes mention of an <code>infinite</code> value that is supported by resolution media queries for targeting screens without resolution constraints. It’s not so much of a “catch-all” value for targeting any sort of screen, but for cases when we’re using the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-new-css-media-query-range-syntax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">media query range syntax</a> to evaluate whether a certain value is greater than, less than, or equal to it:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>For output mediums that have no physical constraints on resolution (such as outputting to vector graphics), this feature must match the <dfn>infinite</dfn> value.

<p>A <strong>relative unit</strong> is extremely well-named because whatever value we use for a relative unit depends on the size of something else. Say we have an HTML element, a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, and we give it an absolute height value (not a relative one) of <code>200px</code>.</p>
<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;div class="box"&gt;
  I am 200 pixels tall
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.box {
  height: 200px;
}</code></pre>
<p>That height will never change. The <code>.box</code> element will be <code>200px</code> tall no matter what. But let’s say we give the element a relative width (not an absolute one) of <code>50%</code>.</p>
<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;div class="box"&gt;
  I am 200 pixels tall and 50% wide
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.box {
  height: 200px;
  width: 50%;
}</code></pre>
<p>What happens to our box? It takes up <code>50%</code>, or half, of the available space on the screen.</p>
<p><iframe id="cp_embed_yLXvKvz" src="https://codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/yLXvKvz?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=yLXvKvz&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allowpaymentrequest="" name="CodePen Embed yLXvKvz" title="CodePen Embed yLXvKvz" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></p>
<p>See that? Go ahead and open that demo in a new window and change the width of the screen. And notice, too, how the height never changes because it’s an absolute length unit in pixels. The width, meanwhile, is fluidly resized as “<code>50%</code> of the available space” changes with the width of the screen.</p>
<p>That’s what we mean when talking about <strong>computed values</strong> with relative numbers. A relative number acts sort of like a multiplier that calculates the value used to set a length based on what type of unit it is relative to. So, a value of <code>3rem</code> is going to wind up becoming a different value when it is computed.</p>
<p>Percentages, like <code>50%</code>, are only one kind of relative unit. We have many, many others. Once again, it’s helpful to break things out into separate groups to understand the differences just as we did earlier with absolute units.</p>
<details>
<summary>
          Percentages      </summary>
<p>We’ve already discussed <strong>percentages</strong> in pretty good detail. What makes a percentage relative is that it computes to a number value based on the length of another element. So, an element that is given <code>width: 25%</code> in a container that is set to <code>width: 1000px</code> computes to <code>width: 250px</code>.</p>

          Font relative units      </summary>
<p>The <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> units we looked at earlier are prime examples of relative units that you will see all over the place. They’re incredibly handy, as we saw, because changing the <code>font-size</code> value of an element’s parent or the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, respectively, causes the element’s own <code>font-size</code> value to update in accordance with the updated value.</p>
<p>In other words, we do not need to directly change an element’s <code>font-size</code> when updating the <code>font-size</code> of other elements — it’s relative and scales with the change.</p>

<p>So, at the expense of beating this concept into the ground, if <code>width: 10ch</code> computes to a certain number of pixels when using one font, it’s likely that the computed value will change if the font is swapped out with another one with either larger or smaller characters.</p>

<p>Ah, viewport units! When we say that something should be 100% wide, that means it takes up the full width of the contain it is in. That’s because a percentage unit is always relative to its nearest parent element. But a   <strong>viewport unit</strong> is always relative to the size of the viewport, or browser window. If an element has a <strong>viewport height</strong> of <code>100vh</code> and a <strong>viewport width</strong> of <code>100vw</code>, then it will be as tall and wide as the full browser window.</p>

<p>This can be a neat way to create something like a hero banner at the top of your website. For example, we can make a banner that is always one half (<code>50vh</code>) the height of the viewport making it prominent no matter how tall someone’s browser is. Change the CSS in the top-left corner of the following demo from <code>height: 50vh</code> to something else, like <code>75vh</code> to see how the banner’s height responds.</p>

<p>There’s something else that’s very important to know when working with viewport units. You know how mobile phones, like iPhone or an Android device, have virtual keyboards where you type directly on the screen? <strong>That keyboard changes the size of the viewport.</strong> That means that whenever the keyboard opens, <code>100vh</code> is no longer the full height of the screen but <em>whatever space is leftover while the keyboard is open</em>, and the layout could get super squished as a result.</p>
<p>That’s why we have the <code>svh</code>, <code>lvh</code>, and <code>dvh</code> units in addition to <code>vh</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><strong>svh</strong></code> is equal to the “small” viewport height, which occurs when the keyboard is open.</li>
<li><code><strong>lvh</strong></code> is equal to the “large” viewport height, which is when the keyboard is disabled and out of view.</li>
<li><code><strong>dvh</strong></code> is a happy medium between <code>svh</code> and <code>lvh</code> in that it is “dynamic” and updates its value accordingly when the keyboard is displayed or not.</li>
<li><strong><code>dvmin</code> / <code>dvmax</code></strong> is the greater ore lesser of <code>dvh</code>, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a bit of a tightrope walk in some cases and a good reason why container queries and their units (which we’ll get to next) are becoming more popular. Check out Ahmed Shader’s article <a href="https://ishadeed.com/article/new-viewport-units/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“New Viewport Units”</a> for a comprehensive explanation about viewport units with detailed examples of the issues you may run into.

<p>Container units are designed to be used with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-cornucopia-of-container-queries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">container queries</a>. Just as we are able to target a specific screen size with a media query, we can target the specific size of a particular element and apply styles using a container query.</p>
<p>We won’t do a big ol’ deep dive into container queries here. The relevant bit is that we have CSS length units that are relative to a container’s size. For example, if we were to define a container:</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.parent-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}</code></pre>
<p>…then we’re watching that element’s <code>inline-size</code> — which is equivalent to <code>width</code> in a horizontal writing mode — and can apply styles to other elements when it reaches certain sizes.</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.child-element {
  background: rebeccapurple;
  width: 100%;

  @container parent (width &gt; 30ch) {
    .child-element {
      background: dodgeblue;
      width: 50cqi;
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Try resizing the following demo. When the parent container is greater than <code>30ch</code>, the child element will change backgrounds and shrink to one-half the parent container’s width, or <code>50cqi</code>.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, there are times when you’re going to see numbers in CSS that don’t have any unit at all — just a single integer or number without anything appended to it.</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">aspect-ratio: 2 / 1; /* Ratio */
column-count: 3; /* Specifies a number of columns */
flex-grow: 1; /* Allows the element to stretch in a flex layout */
grid-column-start: 4; /* Places the element on a specific grid line */
order: 2; /* Sets the order of elemnents in a flex or grid layout */
scale: 2; /* The elementis scaled up or down by a factor */
z-index: 100; /* Element is placed in a numbered layer for stacking */
zoom: 0.2;  /* The element zooms in or out by a factor */</code></pre>
<p>This isn’t a comprehensive list of all the CSS properties that accept unit-less numeric values, but it is a solid picture of when you would use them. You’ll see that in most cases a unit-less number is an explicit detail, such as a specific column to position an element, a specific layer in a stacking context, a boolean that enables or disables a feature, or the order of elements. But note that anytime we declare “zero” as a number, we can write it with or without a prepended unit, as zero always evaluates to zero no matter what unit we’re dealing with.</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">border: 0; /* No border */
box-shadow: 0 0 5px #333; /* No shadow offset */

<p>In some cases, we may want to work with a numeric value, but CSS doesn’t exactly recognize it as one. In these cases, the number is recognized as a “string” value instead, regardless of whether or not it contains alphabetical characters. That’s where we can use <code>@property</code> to create what’s called a “custom property” that evaluates a numeric value in a certain way.</p>
<p>Here’s a good example. There was a time when it was virtually impossible to animate a gradient that changes colors over time because to do so would require (1) a color function that allows us to change a color value’s hue (which we have with <code>hsl()</code>) and (2) being able to interpolate that hue value around the color spectrum, between a range of <code>0deg</code> and <code>360deg</code>.</p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, right? Define a variable that starts at <code>0</code> and then cycles through <code>360</code> degrees at the end of an animation. But this doesn’t work:</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">/* <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44e.png" alt="👎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> */
.element {
  --hue: 0;
  
  animation: rainbow 10s linear infinite;
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(--hue 50% 50%);
}

@keyframes rainbow {
  from { --huw: 0; }
  to { --hue: 360deg; }
}</code></pre>
<p>That’s because CSS reads the variable as a <em>string</em> instead of a <em>number</em>. We have to register that variable as a <strong>custom property</strong> so that CSS aptly reads it as a numeric value.</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">@property --hue {
  syntax: "&lt;number&gt;";
  initial-value: 0;
  inherits: true;
}</code></pre>
<p>There we go! Now that we’ve given CSS a hint that the <code>--hue</code> syntax is that of a <code>&lt;number&gt;</code>, we can animate away!</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">/* <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="👍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> */
@property --hue {
  syntax: "&lt;number&gt;";
  initial-value: 0;
  inherits: true;
}

.element {
  --hue: 0;
  
  animation: rainbow 10s linear infinite;
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(--hue 50% 50%);
}

@keyframes rainbow {
  from { --huw: 0; }
  to { --hue: 360deg; }

<p>This is super tricky because CSS is extremely flexible and there are no definitive or hard-and-fast rules for when to use a specific type of CSS length unit over another. In some cases, you absolutely have to use a specific unit because that’s how a certain CSS feature is specced, like using angle units to set the direction of a linear gradient:</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.element {
  background: linear-gradient(
    135deg, red, blue;
  )
}</code></pre>
<p>The same goes for the values we use in certain color functions, like using percentages to set the saturation and lightness levels in the <code>hsl()</code> function:</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.element {
  background: hsl(0 100% 10%);
}</code></pre>
<p>Speaking of color functions, we define alpha transparency with either an integer or number:</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.element {
  background: hsl(0 100% 10% / 0.5); /* or simply .5 */
}</code></pre>
<p>All that being said, many cases are going to be some degree of “it depends” but there are some instances where it makes sense to use a specific unit in your work.</p>

<p>This way, you can set things up in a way where changing the <code>font-size</code> value of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or a parent element updates the font sizes of their descendants.</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">html {
  font-size: 18px; /* Inherited by all other elements */
}

.parent {
  font-size: 1rem; /* Updates when the `html` size changes */
}

.child {

<p>It’s not a big deal or anything, but leaving off the units shortens the code a smidge, and anytime we’re able to write shorter code it’s an opportunity for faster page performance. The impact may be negligible, but we’re able to do it since <code>0</code> always computes to <code>0</code>, no matter what unit we’re working with.</p>

<p>Container queries in general are so gosh-darn great for responsive layouts because they look at the size of the container and let us apply styles to its descendants when the container is a certain size.</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.parent {
  container: my-container / inline-size; /* Looks at width */
}

.child {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  max-width: 100vh; /* 100% of the viewport */
}

/* When the container is greater than 600px wide */
@container my-container (width &gt;= 600px) {
  .child {
    flex-direction: row;
    max-width: 50%; /* 50% of the parent elenent */
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>So, if we going to size the <code>.child</code> element — or any of its children — it’s worth specifying sizes in relation to the container’s size with container units than, say, the viewport’s size with viewport units.</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line="8,15"><code markup="tt">.parent {
  container: my-container / inline-size; /* Looks at width */
}

.child {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  max-width: 100cqi; /* 100% of the container */
}

/* When the container is greater than 600px wide */
@container my-container (width &gt;= 600px) {
  .child {
    flex-direction: row;
    max-width: 50cqi; /* 50% of the container */
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>Yes, use container units for responsive design, but that only does you good if you know you are in the context of a container. It’s possible, though, that you use the same component in different places, and one of those places might not be a registered container.</p>
<p>In that case, go with a percentage value because percentages are relative to whatever parent element you’re in, regardless of whether or not it’s a container. This way, you can declare an element’s size as <code>100%</code> to take up the full space of whatever parent element contains it.</p>
<p>The only word of caution is to note that we’re only basing the size on the parent. Meanwhile, container units can style any descendant in the container, no matter where it is located.</p>

<p>You may be thinking that viewport units are a bad thing since we’ve been advising against them in so many cases, like font sizing, but they are still incredibly useful, particularly when it comes to establishing a full-page layout.</p>
<p>I say “full-page” layout because container queries are the gold standard for sizing elements according to the space they have in their container. But if we’re working with a full page of containers, this is where viewport units can be used to establish a responsive layout at a higher level.</p>
<p>If the elements of individual containers look at their container for sizing information, then the sizing and placement of individual containers themselves probably ought to look at the viewport since it directly influences the amount of space on the page.</p>

<details>
<summary>
          Element (em) and Relative element (rem) units      </summary>
<p>Let’s talk specifically about these two little buggers. We saw how a percentage unit calculates its size by the size of something else. <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> units are sort of the same, but they are calculated based on the relative font size of specific elements.</p>
<p>Let’s start with <code>em</code> units and say we have an HTML element, a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with a <code>.box</code> class, and we set its font size to <code>20px</code>. That means any text inside of that element is <code>20px</code>.</p>
<p><iframe id="cp_embed_bGRLLzb" src="https://codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/bGRLLzb?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=bGRLLzb&amp;default-tab=css,result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allowpaymentrequest="" name="CodePen Embed bGRLLzb" title="CodePen Embed bGRLLzb" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></p>
<p>Great, now what if we decide we need additional text in the box, and give it a relative font size of <code>1.5em</code>?</p>
<p><iframe id="cp_embed_MWoQVRV" src="https://codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/MWoQVRV?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=MWoQVRV&amp;default-tab=css,result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allowpaymentrequest="" name="CodePen Embed MWoQVRV" title="CodePen Embed MWoQVRV" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></p>
<p>See how a font size of <code>1.5em</code> is larger than the <code>20px</code> text? That’s because <strong>the larger text is based on the box’s font size</strong>. Behind the scenes, this is what the browser is calculating:</p>
<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">20px * 1.5 = 30px</code></pre>
<p>So, the relative font size is multiplied by the pixel font size, which winds up being <code>30px</code>.</p>
<p>And guess what? <code>rem</code> units do the exact same thing. But instead of multiplying itself by the pixel font size of the parent container, it looks at the pixel font size of the actual <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element. By default, that is <code>16px</code>.</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">/* This is the browser's default font size */
html {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.box {
  font-size: 1.5rem; /* 16px * 1.5 = 24px */
}</code></pre>
<p>And if we change the HTML element’s font size to something else?</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">html {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.box {
  font-size: 1.5rem; /* 18px * 1.5 = 27px */
}</code></pre>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
          Character unit (ch)      </summary>
<p>The <strong>character unit (<code>ch</code>)</strong> is another is another unit relative to font size and, while it isn’t used all that often, it is amazingly great at sizing things based on the amount of content displayed in an element, because <em>one character unit equals the width of one character of content</em>. Here’s how I wrap my own head around it. If we have this in our HTML:</p>
<pre rel="HTML" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup" data-line=""><code markup="tt">&lt;p&gt;The big brown dog lazily jumped over the fence.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>…and this CSS:</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">p {
  width: 10ch;
}</code></pre>
<p>What we get is a paragraph that is 10 characters wide. That means the text will break after the tenth character, including spaces.</p>
<p><iframe id="cp_embed_bGRLMeo" src="https://codepen.io/anon/embed/bGRLMeo?height=450&amp;theme-id=1&amp;slug-hash=bGRLMeo&amp;default-tab=result" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allowpaymentrequest="" name="CodePen Embed bGRLMeo" title="CodePen Embed bGRLMeo" class="cp_embed_iframe" style="width:100%;overflow:hidden">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></p>
<p>But note that the words themselves do not break. If the content is supposed to break after 10 characters, the browser will start the next line after a complete word instead of breaking the word into multiple lines, keeping everything easy to read.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering when you might reach for the <code>ch</code> unit, it’s absolutely boss at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/line-length-revisited-following-the-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establishing line lengths that are more pleasant and legible</a>, especially for long form content like this guide you’re reading.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
          Line height unit (lh)      </summary>
<p>The <strong>line-height unit (<code>lh</code>)</strong> looks at the <code>line-height</code> property value of the element’s containing (i.e., parent) element and uses that value to size things up.</p>
<pre rel="CSS" class="wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css" data-line=""><code markup="tt">.parent {
  line-height: 1.5;
}

.child {
  height: 3lh; /* 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 */
}</code></pre>
<p>When would you use this? Personally, I find <code>lh</code> useful for setting an exact height on something based on the number of lines needed for the text. You can see this clearly demonstrated in <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/11/css-responsive-multi-line-ribbon-shapes-part1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Temani Afif’s “CSS Ribbon” effect</a> that uses <code>lh</code> to establish dimensions for each row of text that makes for consistently-sized lines that adapt to whatever the parent element’s <code>font-size</code> value happens to be,</p>

<p>Ever since I was a boy, I’ve been fascinated with movies. I loved the characters and the excitement—but most of all the stories. I wanted to be an actor. And I believed that I’d get to do the things that Indiana Jones did and go on exciting adventures. I even dreamed up ideas for movies that my friends and I could make and star in. But they never went any further. I did, however, end up working in user experience (UX). Now, I realize that there’s an element of theater to UX—I hadn’t really considered it before, but user research is storytelling. And to get the most out of user research, you need to tell a good story where you bring stakeholders—the product team and decision makers—along and get them interested in learning more.</p>
<p><span>Article Continues Below</span></p>
<p>Think of your favorite movie. More than likely it follows a <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/three-act-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-act structure</a> that’s commonly seen in storytelling: the setup, the conflict, and the resolution. The first act shows what exists today, and it helps you get to know the characters and the challenges and problems that they face. Act two introduces the conflict, where the action is. Here, problems grow or get worse. And the third and final act is the resolution. This is where the issues are resolved and the characters learn and change. I believe that this structure is also a great way to think about user research, and I think that it can be especially helpful in explaining user research to others.</p>

<h2 id="section2" class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use storytelling as a structure to do research</strong><a class="subhead-anchor" href="#section2">#section2</a></h2>
<p>It’s sad to say, but many have come to see research as being expendable. If budgets or timelines are tight, research tends to be one of the first things to go. Instead of investing in research, some product managers rely on designers or—worse—their own opinion to make the “right” choices for users based on their experience or accepted best practices. That may get teams some of the way, but that approach can so easily miss out on solving users’ real problems. To remain user-centered, this is something we should avoid. User research elevates design. It keeps it on track, pointing to problems and opportunities. Being aware of the issues with your product and reacting to them can help you stay ahead of your competitors.</p>
<p>In the three-act structure, each act corresponds to a part of the process, and each part is critical to telling the whole story. Let’s look at the different acts and how they align with user research.</p>
<h3 id="section3" class="wp-block-heading">Act one: setup<a class="subhead-anchor" href="#section3">#section3</a></h3>
<p>The setup is all about understanding the background, and that’s where foundational research comes in. <em>Foundational research</em> (also called <em>generative</em>, <em>discovery</em>, or <em>initial</em> research) helps you understand users and identify their problems. You’re learning about what exists today, the challenges users have, and how the challenges affect them—just like in the movies. To do foundational research, you can conduct <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/what-are-contextual-inquiries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contextual inquiries</a> or <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/diary-studies-cd65a61a4f89" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diary studies </a>(or both!), which can help you start to identify problems as well as opportunities. It doesn’t need to be a huge investment in time or money.</p>
<p>Erika Hall writes about<a href="https://medium.com/mule-design/minimum-viable-ethnography-a047e9358df0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> minimum viable ethnography</a>, which can be as simple as spending 15 minutes with a user and asking them one thing: “‘Walk me through your day yesterday.’ That’s it. Present that one request. Shut up and listen to them for 15 minutes. Do your damndest to keep yourself and your interests out of it. Bam, you’re doing ethnography.” According to Hall, <em>“</em>[This] will probably prove quite illuminating. In the highly unlikely case that you didn’t learn anything new or useful, carry on with enhanced confidence in your direction.”  </p>
<p>This makes total sense to me. And I love that this makes user research so accessible. You don’t need to prepare a lot of documentation; you can just recruit participants and do it! This can yield a wealth of information about your users, and it’ll help you better understand them and what’s going on in their lives. That’s really what act one is all about: understanding where users are coming from. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.looppanel.com/blog/strategic-ux-research-is-the-future-with-jared-spool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jared Spool talks about the importance of foundational research</a> and how it should form the bulk of your research. If you can draw from any additional user data that you can get your hands on, such as surveys or analytics, that can supplement what you’ve heard in the foundational studies or even point to areas that need further investigation. Together, all this data paints a clearer picture of the state of things and all its shortcomings. And that’s the beginning of a compelling story. It’s the point in the plot where you realize that the main characters—or the users in this case—are facing challenges that they need to overcome. Like in the movies, this is where you start to build empathy for the characters and root for them to succeed. And hopefully stakeholders are now doing the same. Their sympathy may be with their business, which could be losing money because users can’t complete certain tasks. Or maybe they do empathize with users’ struggles. Either way, act one is your initial hook to get the stakeholders interested and invested.</p>
<p>Once stakeholders begin to understand the value of foundational research, that can open doors to more opportunities that involve users in the decision-making process. And that can guide product teams toward being more user-centered. This benefits everyone—users, the product, and stakeholders. It’s like winning an Oscar in movie terms—it often leads to your product being well received and successful. And this can be an incentive for stakeholders to repeat this process with other products. Storytelling is the key to this process, and knowing how to tell a good story is the only way to get stakeholders to really care about doing more research. </p>
<p>This brings us to act two, where you iteratively evaluate a design or concept to see whether it addresses the issues.</p>
<h3 id="section4" class="wp-block-heading">Act two: conflict<a class="subhead-anchor" href="#section4">#section4</a></h3>
<p>Act two is all about digging deeper into the problems that you identified in act one. This usually involves <em>directional research</em>, such as usability tests, where you assess a potential solution (such as a design) to see whether it addresses the issues that you found. The issues could include unmet needs or problems with a flow or process that’s tripping users up. Like act two in a movie, more issues will crop up along the way. It’s here that you learn more about the characters as they grow and develop through this act. </p>
<p>Usability tests <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should typically include around five participants</a> according to Jakob Nielsen, who found that that number of users can usually identify most of the problems: “As you add more and more users, you learn less and less because you will keep seeing the same things again and again… After the fifth user, you are wasting your time by observing the same findings repeatedly but not learning much new.” </p>
<p>There are parallels with storytelling here too; if you try to tell a story with too many characters, the plot may get lost. Having fewer participants means that each user’s struggles will be more memorable and easier to relay to other stakeholders when talking about the research. This can help convey the issues that need to be addressed while also highlighting the value of doing the research in the first place.</p>
<p>Researchers have run usability tests in person for decades, but you can also <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/moderated-remote-usability-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conduct usability tests remotely</a> using tools like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or other teleconferencing software. This approach has become increasingly popular since the beginning of the pandemic, and it works well. You can think of in-person usability tests like going to a play and remote sessions as more like watching a movie. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. In-person usability research is a much richer experience. Stakeholders can experience the sessions with other stakeholders. You also get real-time reactions—including surprise, agreement, disagreement, and discussions about what they’re seeing. Much like going to a play, where audiences get to take in the stage, the costumes, the lighting, and the actors’ interactions, in-person research lets you see users up close, including their body language, how they interact with the moderator, and how the scene is set up.</p>
<p>If in-person usability testing is like watching a play—staged and controlled—then conducting usability testing in the field is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersive_theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immersive theater</a> where any two sessions might be very different from one another. You can take usability testing into the field by <a href="https://boxesandarrows.com/taking-research-out-of-the-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a replica of the space where users interact</a> with the product and then conduct your research there. Or you can go out to meet users at their location to do your research. With either option, you get to see how things work in context, things come up that wouldn’t have in a lab environment—and conversion can shift in entirely different directions. As researchers, you have less control over how these sessions go, but this can sometimes help you understand users even better. Meeting users where they are can provide clues to the external forces that could be affecting how they use your product. In-person usability tests provide another level of detail that’s often missing from remote usability tests. </p>
<p>That’s not to say that the “movies”—remote sessions—aren’t a good option. Remote sessions can reach a wider audience. They allow a lot more stakeholders to be involved in the research and to see what’s going on. And they open the doors to a much wider geographical pool of users. But with any remote session there is the potential of time wasted if participants can’t log in or get their microphone working. </p>
<p>The benefit of <a href="https://boxesandarrows.com/usability-testing-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usability testing, whether remote or in person</a>, is that you get to see real users interact with the designs in real time, and you can ask them questions to understand their thought processes and grasp of the solution. This can help you not only identify problems but also glean why they’re problems in the first place. Furthermore, you can test hypotheses and gauge whether your thinking is correct. By the end of the sessions, you’ll have a much clearer picture of how usable the designs are and whether they work for their intended purposes. Act two is the heart of the story—where the excitement is—but there can be surprises too. This is equally true of usability tests. <a href="https://articles.centercentre.com/three_hund_million_button/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Often, participants will say unexpected things</a>, which change the way that you look at things—and these twists in the story can move things in new directions. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, user research is sometimes seen as expendable. And too often usability testing is the only research process that some stakeholders think that they ever need. In fact, if the designs that you’re evaluating in the usability test aren’t grounded in a solid understanding of your users (foundational research), there’s not much to be gained by doing usability testing in the first place. That’s because you’re narrowing the focus of what you’re getting feedback on, without understanding the users’ needs. As a result, there’s no way of knowing whether the designs might solve a problem that users have. It’s only feedback on a particular design in the context of a usability test.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you only do foundational research, while you might have set out to solve the right problem, you won’t know whether the thing that you’re building will actually solve that. This illustrates the importance of doing both foundational and directional research. </p>
<p>In act two, stakeholders will—hopefully—get to watch the story unfold in the user sessions, which creates the conflict and tension in the current design by surfacing their highs and lows. And in turn, this can help motivate stakeholders to address the issues that come up.</p>
<h3 id="section5" class="wp-block-heading">Act three: resolution<a class="subhead-anchor" href="#section5">#section5</a></h3>
<p>While the first two acts are about understanding the background and the tensions that can propel stakeholders into action, the third part is about resolving the problems from the first two acts. While it’s important to have an audience for the first two acts, it’s crucial that they stick around for the final act. That means the whole product team, including developers, UX practitioners, business analysts, delivery managers, product managers, and any other stakeholders that have a say in the next steps. It allows the whole team to hear users’ feedback together, ask questions, and discuss what’s possible within the project’s constraints. And it lets the UX research and design teams clarify, suggest alternatives, or give more context behind their decisions. So you can get everyone on the same page and get agreement on the way forward.</p>
<p>This act is mostly told in voiceover with some audience participation. The researcher is the narrator, who paints a picture of the issues and what the future of the product could look like given the things that the team has learned. They give the stakeholders their recommendations and their guidance on creating this vision.</p>
<p>Nancy Duarte in the <em>Harvard Business Review</em> offers an approach to <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/structure-your-presentation-li" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structuring presentations that follow a persuasive story</a>. “The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most effective presenters </a>use the same techniques as great storytellers: By reminding people of the status quo and then revealing the path to a better way, they set up a conflict that needs to be resolved,” writes Duarte. “That tension helps them persuade the audience to adopt a new mindset or behave differently.”</p>
<figure id="figure2" class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="960" height="263" src="https://i0.wp.com/alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/user-research-is-storytelling-2.jpg?resize=960%2C263&amp;ssl=1" alt="A diagram, depicting a persuasive story pattern, segmented into distinct sections that outline a narrative flow. Starting with “Beginning,” followed by “Middle,” and concluding with “End.” The “Beginning” starts with a box labeled “What is.” A line rises up to the box labeled “What could be.” A line goes from this box into “Middle” and back down to “What is” and then back up to “What could be.” This repeats one more time in “Middle,” before a line goes from “What could be” up to a box labeled “Vision of the future” in “End.” “'Call to action” is written below the “Vision of the future” box to signify that the vision is a call to action." class="wp-image-7174426" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/user-research-is-storytelling-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C280&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/user-research-is-storytelling-2.jpg?resize=300%2C82&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/user-research-is-storytelling-2.jpg?resize=768%2C210&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/user-research-is-storytelling-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C420&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/user-research-is-storytelling-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A persuasive story pattern.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This type of structure aligns well with research results, and particularly results from usability tests. It provides evidence for “what is”—the problems that you’ve identified. And “what could be”—your recommendations on how to address them. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>You can reinforce your recommendations with examples of things that competitors are doing that could address these issues or with examples where competitors are gaining an edge. Or they can be visual, like quick mockups of how a new design could look that solves a problem. These can help generate conversation and momentum. And this continues until the end of the session when you’ve wrapped everything up in the conclusion by summarizing the main issues and suggesting a way forward. This is the part where you reiterate the main themes or problems and what they mean for the product—the denouement of the story. This stage gives stakeholders the next steps and hopefully the momentum to take those steps!</p>
<p>While we are nearly at the end of this story, let’s reflect on the idea that user research is storytelling. All the elements of a good story are there in the three-act structure of user research: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Act one</strong>: You meet the protagonists (the users) and the antagonists (the problems affecting users). This is the beginning of the plot. In act one, researchers might use methods including contextual inquiry, ethnography, diary studies, surveys, and analytics. The output of these methods can include personas, empathy maps, user journeys, and analytics dashboards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Act two</strong>: Next, there’s character development. There’s conflict and tension as the protagonists encounter problems and challenges, which they must overcome. In act two, researchers might use methods including usability testing, competitive benchmarking, and heuristics evaluation. The output of these can include usability findings reports, UX strategy documents, usability guidelines, and best practices.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Act three</strong>: The protagonists triumph and you see what a better future looks like. In act three, researchers may use methods including presentation decks, storytelling, and digital media. The output of these can be: presentation decks, video clips, audio clips, and pictures. </li>
</ul>
<p>The researcher has multiple roles: they’re the storyteller, the director, and the producer. The participants have a small role, but they are significant characters (in the research). And the stakeholders are the audience. But the most important thing is to get the story right and to use storytelling to tell users’ stories through research. By the end, the stakeholders should walk away with a purpose and an eagerness to resolve the product’s ills. </p>
<p>So the next time that you’re planning research with clients or you’re speaking to stakeholders about research that you’ve done, think about how you can weave in some storytelling. Ultimately, user research is a win-win for everyone, and you just need to get stakeholders interested in how the story ends.</p>

<p>Ever since I was a boy, I’ve been fascinated with movies. I loved the characters and the excitement—but most of all the stories. I wanted to be an actor. And I believed that I’d get to do the things that Indiana Jones did and go on exciting adventures. I even dreamed up ideas for movies that my friends and I could make and star in. But they never went any further. I did, however, end up working in user experience (UX). Now, I realize that there’s an element of theater to UX—I hadn’t really considered it before, but user research is storytelling. And to get the most out of user research, you need to tell a good story where you bring stakeholders—the product team and decision makers—along and get them interested in learning more.</p>
<p><span>Article Continues Below</span></p>
<p>Think of your favorite movie. More than likely it follows a <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/three-act-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three-act structure</a> that’s commonly seen in storytelling: the setup, the conflict, and the resolution. The first act shows what exists today, and it helps you get to know the characters and the challenges and problems that they face. Act two introduces the conflict, where the action is. Here, problems grow or get worse. And the third and final act is the resolution. This is where the issues are resolved and the characters learn and change. I believe that this structure is also a great way to think about user research, and I think that it can be especially helpful in explaining user research to others.</p>

<h3 id="section4" class="wp-block-heading">Act two: conflict<a class="subhead-anchor" href="#section4">#section4</a></h3>
<p>Act two is all about digging deeper into the problems that you identified in act one. This usually involves <em>directional research</em>, such as usability tests, where you assess a potential solution (such as a design) to see whether it addresses the issues that you found. The issues could include unmet needs or problems with a flow or process that’s tripping users up. Like act two in a movie, more issues will crop up along the way. It’s here that you learn more about the characters as they grow and develop through this act. </p>
<p>Usability tests <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should typically include around five participants</a> according to Jakob Nielsen, who found that that number of users can usually identify most of the problems: “As you add more and more users, you learn less and less because you will keep seeing the same things again and again… After the fifth user, you are wasting your time by observing the same findings repeatedly but not learning much new.” </p>
<p>There are parallels with storytelling here too; if you try to tell a story with too many characters, the plot may get lost. Having fewer participants means that each user’s struggles will be more memorable and easier to relay to other stakeholders when talking about the research. This can help convey the issues that need to be addressed while also highlighting the value of doing the research in the first place.</p>
<p>Researchers have run usability tests in person for decades, but you can also <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/moderated-remote-usability-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conduct usability tests remotely</a> using tools like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or other teleconferencing software. This approach has become increasingly popular since the beginning of the pandemic, and it works well. You can think of in-person usability tests like going to a play and remote sessions as more like watching a movie. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. In-person usability research is a much richer experience. Stakeholders can experience the sessions with other stakeholders. You also get real-time reactions—including surprise, agreement, disagreement, and discussions about what they’re seeing. Much like going to a play, where audiences get to take in the stage, the costumes, the lighting, and the actors’ interactions, in-person research lets you see users up close, including their body language, how they interact with the moderator, and how the scene is set up.</p>
<p>If in-person usability testing is like watching a play—staged and controlled—then conducting usability testing in the field is like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersive_theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">immersive theater</a> where any two sessions might be very different from one another. You can take usability testing into the field by <a href="https://boxesandarrows.com/taking-research-out-of-the-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a replica of the space where users interact</a> with the product and then conduct your research there. Or you can go out to meet users at their location to do your research. With either option, you get to see how things work in context, things come up that wouldn’t have in a lab environment—and conversion can shift in entirely different directions. As researchers, you have less control over how these sessions go, but this can sometimes help you understand users even better. Meeting users where they are can provide clues to the external forces that could be affecting how they use your product. In-person usability tests provide another level of detail that’s often missing from remote usability tests. </p>
<p>That’s not to say that the “movies”—remote sessions—aren’t a good option. Remote sessions can reach a wider audience. They allow a lot more stakeholders to be involved in the research and to see what’s going on. And they open the doors to a much wider geographical pool of users. But with any remote session there is the potential of time wasted if participants can’t log in or get their microphone working. </p>
<p>The benefit of <a href="https://boxesandarrows.com/usability-testing-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usability testing, whether remote or in person</a>, is that you get to see real users interact with the designs in real time, and you can ask them questions to understand their thought processes and grasp of the solution. This can help you not only identify problems but also glean why they’re problems in the first place. Furthermore, you can test hypotheses and gauge whether your thinking is correct. By the end of the sessions, you’ll have a much clearer picture of how usable the designs are and whether they work for their intended purposes. Act two is the heart of the story—where the excitement is—but there can be surprises too. This is equally true of usability tests. <a href="https://articles.centercentre.com/three_hund_million_button/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Often, participants will say unexpected things</a>, which change the way that you look at things—and these twists in the story can move things in new directions. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, user research is sometimes seen as expendable. And too often usability testing is the only research process that some stakeholders think that they ever need. In fact, if the designs that you’re evaluating in the usability test aren’t grounded in a solid understanding of your users (foundational research), there’s not much to be gained by doing usability testing in the first place. That’s because you’re narrowing the focus of what you’re getting feedback on, without understanding the users’ needs. As a result, there’s no way of knowing whether the designs might solve a problem that users have. It’s only feedback on a particular design in the context of a usability test.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you only do foundational research, while you might have set out to solve the right problem, you won’t know whether the thing that you’re building will actually solve that. This illustrates the importance of doing both foundational and directional research. </p>
<p>In act two, stakeholders will—hopefully—get to watch the story unfold in the user sessions, which creates the conflict and tension in the current design by surfacing their highs and lows. And in turn, this can help motivate stakeholders to address the issues that come up.</p>
<h3 id="section5" class="wp-block-heading">Act three: resolution<a class="subhead-anchor" href="#section5">#section5</a></h3>
<p>While the first two acts are about understanding the background and the tensions that can propel stakeholders into action, the third part is about resolving the problems from the first two acts. While it’s important to have an audience for the first two acts, it’s crucial that they stick around for the final act. That means the whole product team, including developers, UX practitioners, business analysts, delivery managers, product managers, and any other stakeholders that have a say in the next steps. It allows the whole team to hear users’ feedback together, ask questions, and discuss what’s possible within the project’s constraints. And it lets the UX research and design teams clarify, suggest alternatives, or give more context behind their decisions. So you can get everyone on the same page and get agreement on the way forward.</p>
<p>This act is mostly told in voiceover with some audience participation. The researcher is the narrator, who paints a picture of the issues and what the future of the product could look like given the things that the team has learned. They give the stakeholders their recommendations and their guidance on creating this vision.</p>
<p>Nancy Duarte in the <em>Harvard Business Review</em> offers an approach to <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/structure-your-presentation-li" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structuring presentations that follow a persuasive story</a>. “The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most effective presenters </a>use the same techniques as great storytellers: By reminding people of the status quo and then revealing the path to a better way, they set up a conflict that needs to be resolved,” writes Duarte. “That tension helps them persuade the audience to adopt a new mindset or behave differently.”</p>

<p>This type of structure aligns well with research results, and particularly results from usability tests. It provides evidence for “what is”—the problems that you’ve identified. And “what could be”—your recommendations on how to address them. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>You can reinforce your recommendations with examples of things that competitors are doing that could address these issues or with examples where competitors are gaining an edge. Or they can be visual, like quick mockups of how a new design could look that solves a problem. These can help generate conversation and momentum. And this continues until the end of the session when you’ve wrapped everything up in the conclusion by summarizing the main issues and suggesting a way forward. This is the part where you reiterate the main themes or problems and what they mean for the product—the denouement of the story. This stage gives stakeholders the next steps and hopefully the momentum to take those steps!</p>
<p>While we are nearly at the end of this story, let’s reflect on the idea that user research is storytelling. All the elements of a good story are there in the three-act structure of user research: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Act one</strong>: You meet the protagonists (the users) and the antagonists (the problems affecting users). This is the beginning of the plot. In act one, researchers might use methods including contextual inquiry, ethnography, diary studies, surveys, and analytics. The output of these methods can include personas, empathy maps, user journeys, and analytics dashboards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Act two</strong>: Next, there’s character development. There’s conflict and tension as the protagonists encounter problems and challenges, which they must overcome. In act two, researchers might use methods including usability testing, competitive benchmarking, and heuristics evaluation. The output of these can include usability findings reports, UX strategy documents, usability guidelines, and best practices.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Act three</strong>: The protagonists triumph and you see what a better future looks like. In act three, researchers may use methods including presentation decks, storytelling, and digital media. The output of these can be: presentation decks, video clips, audio clips, and pictures. </li>
</ul>
<p>The researcher has multiple roles: they’re the storyteller, the director, and the producer. The participants have a small role, but they are significant characters (in the research). And the stakeholders are the audience. But the most important thing is to get the story right and to use storytelling to tell users’ stories through research. By the end, the stakeholders should walk away with a purpose and an eagerness to resolve the product’s ills. </p>
<p>So the next time that you’re planning research with clients or you’re speaking to stakeholders about research that you’ve done, think about how you can weave in some storytelling. Ultimately, user research is a win-win for everyone, and you just need to get stakeholders interested in how the story ends.</p>
